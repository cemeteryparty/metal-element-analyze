## Description

Given 177 pictures, the tasks is to analyze the metal element of it.

For each picture, we need to analyze the copper content(%), gold and silver content(ppm).

We try to use simple CNN structure to complete this task.

## Note

The model I design has 3 conv layers, 2 dense layers.

The model is very depth because the dataset is small.

I also notice that the way of dataset augmentation associated to the model.
